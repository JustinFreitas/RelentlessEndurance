Relentless Endurance v1.0, by Justin Freitas

ReadMe and Usage Notes

There is a radial menu option in the 9 o'clock position when right clicking on a CT actor that allows for Undead Fortitude to be applied to an Unconscious actor.  If invoked, it will leave the actor with one wound remaining until max hp and also remove the Unconscious and Prone effects if they exist.

A chat command /relentless was added to do the application to apply the Undead Fortitude result to the specified Combat Tracker actor (case sensitive).  The first match found will be used.  For example: /relentless Zeb the Half-Orc

Changelist:
- v1.0 - Initial version.
