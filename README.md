Relentless Endurance v1.0, by Justin Freitas

ReadMe and Usage Notes

The Relentless Endurance extension is based off of another 5e extension named Undead Fortitude.  It's very similar in that it will prevent the actor from going unconscious and leave them with 1hp per the Relentless Endurance rules.  The difference between this and Undead Fortitude is that there is no saving throw for Relentless Endurance.  Also, for PCs, the Relentless Endurance power will be created (if it doesn't already exist) and the use of the power will be checked when it is invoked.  If the user has already used their Relentless Endurance, it will not save them from going unconscious.

There is a radial menu option in the 9 o'clock position when right clicking on a CT actor that allows for Undead Fortitude to be applied to an Unconscious actor.  If invoked, it will leave the actor with one wound remaining until max hp and also remove the Unconscious and Prone effects if they exist.

A chat command /relentless was added to do the application to apply the Undead Fortitude result to the specified Combat Tracker actor (case sensitive).  The first match found will be used.  For example: /relentless Zeb the Half-Orc
